Subject: [PATCH 343/406] PENIDNG: arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-main: Make the
 scm_conf node a simple-bus

The scm_conf bus need not be syscon. Now that we have pcie*_ctrl child
nodes for 'ti,syscon-pcie-ctrl' property for pcie nodes, change scm_conf
node to simple-bus.
Also remove reg proerty as it is not needed by "simple-bus".
This gets rid of dtbs warnings while adding clock-controller nodes for
audio_external_refclk.
