Subject: [PATCH 278/508] media: cadence: csi2rx: Fix stream data configuration

Firstly, there is no VC_EN bit present in the STREAM_DATA_CFG register.
Bit 31 is part of the VL_SELECT field. Remove it completely.

Secondly, it makes little sense to enable ith virtual channel for ith
stream. Sure, there might be a use-case that demands it. But there might
also be a use case that demands all streams to use the 0th virtual
channel. Prefer this case over the former because it is less arbitrary
and also makes it very clear what the limitations of the current driver
is instead of giving a false impression that multiple virtual channels
are supported.
