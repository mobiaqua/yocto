Subject: [PATCH 166/322] drm/tidss: Fix atomic_flush check

tidss_crtc_atomic_flush() checks if the crtc is enabled, and if not,
returns immediately as there's no reason to do any register changes.

However, the code checks for 'crtc->state->enable', which does not
reflect the actual HW state. We should instead look at the
'crtc->state->active' flag.

This causes the tidss_crtc_atomic_flush() to proceed with the flush even
if the active state is false, which then causes us to hit the
WARN_ON(!crtc->state->event) check.

Fix this by checking the active flag, and while at it, fix the related
debug print which had "active" and "needs modeset" wrong way.
