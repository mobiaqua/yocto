Subject: [PATCH 054/130] media: img: vxe-vxd: encoder: Expose I-Frame Period
 Control

Functionality was already in place to properly set I-frame period for a
given h264 encode. However, it was not being exposed to control menu making
it irrelevant. Add this to the control menu to allow user to select their
desired I-frame period.

User can manipulate I-frame period by adding the following control after
the v4l2h264enc elemenet in gstreamer pipelines:

v4l2h264enc extra-controls="enc,h264_i_frame_period=3"

This will make every 3rd frame an I-frame.
