Subject: [PATCH 08/34] drm/tidss: Make zpos immutable for primary plane

The new version of weston seems to be setting
non-zero value of zpos for primary plane too [1].

As primary plane sits at the bottom and is always
"on" and overlay planes are "overlayed" on top
of primary, set zpos value of primary plane as
immutable with 0 value.

For overlay plane, set minimum value in range for zpos
value as 1 so that it doesn't overlap with
value for primary plane.

This is based off :
